//* Your younger brother is 10 years old, and you are 15 years old. Write a program to check whether your younger brother's age is less than or equal to your age.

let youngerBrotherAge = 10;

//! #problem-2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
//* The passing marks in an exam are 33. Suppose you got 45. Check whether you passed or not.

//* You have read 10 books, and your friend is reading 10. Check whether you have read the same number of books or not.

//* You have 15 biscuits and your friend has 20. Check whether you got fewer biscuits than your friend.

let iHaveBiscuits = 15;

//! #problem-7 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
//* You studied today (true), and your friend did not study (false). Check, did you do the same thing?

let iStudyToday = true;
let friStudy = false;

console.log(iStudyToday == friStudy); // output: false; because true is not equal to false.
